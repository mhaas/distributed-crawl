/**
 * This class holds a tuple of Term and frequency.
 *
 * It is used in @IndexerMap.java to implement the key-value inversion pattern.
 *
 * It implements Comparable. When compared, first the Term is compared. If both
 * terms are not equal, the frequency is compared.
 *
 * This has the effect that the key arrive in the right order so the index is
 * sorted by key while additionally sorting the postings list for the term.
 * 
 * This is used in conjunction with @MergerPartitioner to ensure that keys
 * with the same term arrive at the same reducer.
 * 
 * If multiple reducers are used, the result files are probably easily concatenated (?!).
